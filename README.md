# Sentiment_Analysis_using_NLP
<h4>The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model that can accurately predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of textual data, such as product reviews. The dataset used for this project is a collection of reviews. </h4>

 <p> Use of NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is used in this project to transform raw textual data into a format that can be effectively used by machine learning algorithms. The steps involved typically include:

Text Cleaning: Removing special characters, stopwords, and punctuation to reduce noise in the data.
Tokenization: Splitting text into individual words or tokens.
Vectorization: Converting text into numerical representations using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Modeling: Training machine learning models on the processed data to predict sentiment.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

numpy
pandas
nltk
scikit-learn </p>
